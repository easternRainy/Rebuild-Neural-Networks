# RebuildNeuralNetworks

In this repo, I rebuild neural networks from scratch using Java. 

- Neural.java simulates the behavior of an Artificial Neural.
- Activation.java contains activation functions and their derivative.
- Layer.java is an abstract class for several neural networks layers:
	- InputLayer.java 
	- FullyConnectedLayer.java
- NeuralNetWork.java puts everything together.
